## About Me

Hello, my name is Tracy. I am a Biomedical Engineer with 3+ years of experience in data analysis, research, presenting, and scientific writing. For the last three years, I have worked as an engineer in a Medical Device Company. Prior to working in this industry, I completed a BA in Biological Sciences and an MS in Biomedical Engineering. 

I am extremely passionate about learning and can often be found teaching myself something, whether it be how to play the ukulele, make a French lemon tart, or how to use programming to analyze scientific data. I love digging into a mystery, especially if numbers are involved. My current plan is to leverage my biological and engineering background into a Data Science role and make the world have just a bit more order and clarity.
